Popups For MAUI 
---
This is a rewrite of the older "Rg.Plugins.Popups" made by Rotorgames. There are many things i want to change with this plugin, such as adding returnable tasks, integrating with MAUI tightly and a general simplification which is why i have decided to create a new plugin.

In SampleMaui, you will see the general idea of how to get this up and running, as well as the changes made. right now, i use CSharp pages, however, i do intend on making MVU, MVVM and whatever other coding paradigms i can find version of the same sample so people find it easier to use this.
